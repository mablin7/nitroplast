  abstract = {A few genera of diatoms that form stable partnerships with N2-fixing filamentous cyanobacteria Richelia spp. are widespread in the open ocean. A unique feature of the diatom-Richelia symbioses is the symbiont cellular location spans a continuum of integration (epibiont, periplasmic, and endobiont) that is reflected in the symbiont genome size and content. In this study, we analyzed genomes derived from cultures and environmental metagenome-assembled genomes of Richelia symbionts, focusing on characters indicative of genome evolution. Our results show an enrichment of short-length transposases and pseudogenes in the periplasmic symbiont genomes, suggesting an active and transitionary period in genome evolution. By contrast, genomes of endobionts exhibited fewer transposases and pseudogenes, reflecting advanced stages of genome reduction. Pangenome analyses identified that endobionts streamline their genomes and retain most genes in the core genome, whereas periplasmic symbionts and epibionts maintain larger flexible genomes, indicating higher genomic plasticity compared with the genomes of endobionts. Functional gene comparisons with other N2-fixing cyanobacteria revealed that Richelia endobionts have similar patterns of metabolic loss but are distinguished by the absence of specific pathways (e.g., cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase and lipid A) that increase both dependency and direct interactions with their respective hosts. In conclusion, our findings underscore the dynamic nature of genome reduction in N2-fixing cyanobacterial symbionts and demonstrate the diatom-Richelia symbioses as a valuable and rare model to study genome evolution in the transitional stages from a free-living facultative symbiont to a host-dependent endobiont.},

  abstract = {UCYN-A is a phenomenal diazotrophic cyanobacterium with significant ecological importance. UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 are the two most abundant ecotypes. Recently, the striking discovery of nitroplast, a novel N2-fixing organelle in cultured B. bigelowii/UCYN-A2 endosymbiont, indicated the possibility that UCYN-A2 has evolved beyond endosymbiosis to an early phase of organellogenesis. This study addresses the following critical question: What evolutionary heterogeneity has emerged between UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2? To investigate this issue, we comprehensively compared a total of seven genomes from UCYN-A2 and UCYN-A1. Under similar genome organizations, GC content, and gene composition, we still detected abundant genetic differences, including group–unique orthogroups, ANI below 85\%, and 577 UCYN-A2-unique INDELs in single-copy orthologous genes (SCOGs). Moreover, we also focused on the orthologous genes of 40 metabolic-pathway genes in nitroplast. In addition to high-informative SNPs and INDELs possessing distinct interlineage differences, we traced abundant codon usage “signatures” that serve as lineage-unique molecular markers. Most notably, we successfully established a strain-level identification map for UCYN-A strains using codon aversion motifs, which represents the first case study of this approach in bacteria. In summary, all the comparative results reported here collectively indicate that UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 have evolved remarkable genomic heterogeneities. Furthermore, the findings of this work will definitely promote our current understanding of codon aversion and the evolution of UCYN-A.},

  abstract = {Endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) and import of host-encoded proteins have been considered hallmarks of organelles necessary for stable integration of two cells. However, newer endosymbiotic models have challenged the origin and timing of such genetic integration during organellogenesis. Epithemia diatoms contain diazoplasts, obligate endosymbionts derived from cyanobacteria that are closely phylogenetically related to UCYN-A, a recently described nitrogen-fixing organelle. Diazoplasts function as permanent membrane compartments in Epithemia hosts, but it is unknown if genetic integration has occurred. We report genomic analyses of two Epithemia diatom species, freshwater Epithemia clementina and marine E. pelagica, which are highly divergent but share a common ancestor at the origin of the endosymbiosis {\textless}35Mya. We find minimal evidence for genetic integration. Segments of fragmented and rearranged DNA from the diazoplast were detected integrated into the E. clementina nuclear genome, but the transfers that have occurred so far are nonfunctional. No DNA or gene transfers were detected in E. pelagica. In E. clementina, 6 host-encoded proteins of unknown function were identified in the diazoplast proteome, far fewer than detected in recently acquired endosymbiotic organelles. Overall, Epithemia diazoplasts are a valuable counterpoint to existing organelle models, demonstrating that endosymbionts can function as integral compartments—maintained over millions of years of host speciation—absent significant genetic integration. The minimal genetic integration makes diazoplasts valuable blueprints for bioengineering endosymbiotic compartments de novo.},

  abstract = {Symbiotic interactions between unicellular microbes were key to evolution of eukaryotes because they led to the evolution of organelles such as the chloroplast and mitochondria [1]. Nitrogen (N2) fixation is a key metabolic process on Earth, carried out exclusively by microbes that often form symbiotic partnerships with diverse hosts. Despite many of these interactions being endosymbiotic, N2 fixation has never been associated with any extant organelle. A genomically reduced cyanobacterium called UCYN-A is a N2-fixing endosymbiont (spheroid body) of a marine unicellular haptophyte, Braarudosphaera bigelowii, and supplies fixed nitrogen to the host in return for fixed carbon [2]. This symbiosis is particularly intriguing because it appears to be an obligate endosymbiosis similar to the hypothetical “nitroplast”, evidenced by extreme genome and metabolic reduction in the UCYN-A cyanobacterium. The UCYN-A symbiosis provides a unique model system for understanding the basic mechanisms of organellogenesis (the evolution of an organelle from an endosymbiont), cellular coordination of growth of unicellular symbiotic partners, and how symbiosis enables aerobic N2 fixation. Key to maintaining endosymbionts and organelles is coordinated cell growth and division, yet nothing was known about how N2-fixing spheroid bodies divide with their host cells. To explore the role of the endosymbiont in the host division, we employed soft X-ray tomography (SXT) [3]. The technique indicated a tight coordination of the cell division with the endosymbiont and optimized localization of host cell’s organelles interacting with the UCYN-A spheroid body. Application of SXT to this unusual symbiosis between two single-celled organisms affirms coordinated structural reorganization between the two organisms to maintain the N2-fixing function of the spheroid body. These findings are significant for understanding symbiotic N2 fixation and organellogenesis [5].},

Atelocyanobacterium thalassa) has been recognized as a globally distributed, early stage, nitrogen-fixing organelle (the “nitroplast”) of cyanobacterial origin present in the haptophyte alga Braarudosphaera bigelowii. Although the nitroplast was recognized as UCYN-A2, not all sublineages of UCYN-A have been confirmed as nitroplasts, and full genomes are still lacking for several known sublineages. We investigated the differences between UCYN-A sublineages by sequencing and assembly of metagenomic sequences acquired from cultured biomass from NW Atlantic seawater, which yielded near-complete Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) corresponding to UCYN-A1, -A4, and the plastid of the UCYN-A4-associated B. bigelowii. Weekly time-series data paired with the recurrence of specific microbes in cultures used for metagenomics gave further insight into the microbial community associated with the algal/UCYN-A complex. The UCYN-A1 MAG was found to have 99\% average nucleotide identity (ANI) to the Pacific-derived reference genome despite its Atlantic Ocean origin. Comparison of the UCYN-A4 MAG (the initial genome sequenced from this sublineage) to other genomes showed that UCYN-A4 is sufficiently genetically distinct from both UCYN-A1 and UCYN-A2 (ANI of ∼83\% and ∼85\%, respectively) to be considered its own sublineage, but more similar to UCYN-A2 than -A1, supporting its possible classification as a nitroplast. The B. bigelowii plastid sequence was compared with published plastid sequences (sharing 78\% ANI with Chrysochromulina parva) adding to our understanding of genomic variation across Haptophyta organelles and emphasizing the need for further full genomic sequencing of B. bigelowii genotypes and their organelles.},

               Dinitrogen (N2) fixation is the major source of reactive nitrogen in the ocean and has been considered to occur specifically in low-latitude oligotrophic oceans. Recent studies have shown that N2 fixation also occurs in the polar regions and thus is a global process, although the physiological and ecological characteristics of polar diazotrophs are not yet known. Here, we successfully reconstructed diazotroph genomes, including that of cyanobacterium UCYN-A (Candidatus ‘Atelocyanobacterium thalassa’), from metagenome data corresponding to 111 samples isolated from the Arctic Ocean. These diazotrophs were highly abundant in the Arctic Ocean (max., 1.28\% of the total microbial community), suggesting that they have important roles in the Arctic ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles. Further, we show that diazotrophs within genera Arcobacter, Psychromonas, and Oceanobacter are prevalent in the \&lt;0.2 µm fraction in the Arctic Ocean, indicating that current methods cannot capture their N2 fixation. Diazotrophs in the Arctic Ocean were either Arctic-endemic or cosmopolitan species from their global distribution patterns. Arctic-endemic diazotrophs, including Arctic UCYN-A, were similar to low-latitude-endemic and cosmopolitan diazotrophs in genome-wide function, however, they had unique gene sets (e.g., diverse aromatics degradation genes), suggesting adaptations to Arctic-specific conditions. Cosmopolitan diazotrophs were generally non-cyanobacteria and commonly had the gene that encodes the cold-inducible RNA chaperone, which presumably makes their survival possible even in deep, cold waters of global ocean and polar surface waters. This study shows global distribution pattern of diazotrophs with their genomes and provides clues to answering the question of how diazotrophs can inhabit polar waters.},

  abstract = {Crocosphaera watsonii is a unicellular N2-fixing (diazotrophic) cyanobacterium observed in tropical and subtropical oligotrophic oceans. As a diazotroph, it can be a source of bioavailable nitrogen (N) to the microbial community in N-limited environments, and this may fuel primary production in the regions where it occurs. Crocosphaera watsonii has been the subject of intense study, both in culture and in field populations. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the phylogenetic and physiological diversity of C. watsonii, its distribution, and its ecological niche. Analysis of the relationships among the individual Crocosphaera species and related free-living and symbiotic lineages of diazotrophs based on the nifH gene have shown that the C. watsonii group holds a basal position and that its sequence is more similar to Rippkaea and Zehria than to other Crocosphaera species. This finding warrants further scrutiny to determine if the placement is related to a horizontal gene transfer event. Here, the nifH UCYN-B gene copy number from a recent synthesis effort was used as a proxy for relative C. watsonii abundance to examine patterns of C. watsonii distribution as a function of environmental factors, like iron and phosphorus concentration, and complimented with a synthesis of C. watsonii physiology. Furthermore, we have summarized the current knowledge of C. watsonii with regards to N2 fixation, photosynthesis, and quantitative modeling of physiology. Because N availability can limit primary production, C. watsonii is widely recognized for its importance to carbon and N cycling in ocean ecosystems, and we conclude this review by highlighting important topics for further research on this important species.},

  abstract = {The origin of nitrogen fixation is an important issue in evolutionary biology. While nitrogen is required by all living organisms, only a small fraction of bacteria and archaea can fix nitrogen. The prevailing view is that nitrogen fixation first evolved in archaea and was later transferred to bacteria. However, nitrogen-fixing (Nif) bacteria are far larger in number and far more diverse in ecological niches than Nif archaea. We, therefore, propose the bacteria-first hypothesis, which postulates that nitrogen fixation first evolved in bacteria and was later transferred to archaea. As {\textgreater}30,000 prokaryotic genomes have been sequenced, we conduct an in-depth comparison of the two hypotheses. We first identify the six genes involved in nitrogen fixation in all sequenced prokaryotic genomes and then reconstruct phylogenetic trees using the six Nif proteins individually or in combination. In each of these trees, the earliest lineages are bacterial Nif protein sequences and in the oldest clade (group) the archaeal sequences are all nested inside bacterial sequences, suggesting that the Nif proteins first evolved in bacteria. The bacteria-first hypothesis is further supported by the observation that the majority of Nif archaea carry the major bacterial Mo (molybdenum) transporter (ModABC) rather than the archaeal Mo transporter (WtpABC). Moreover, in our phylogeny of all available ModA and WtpA protein sequences, the earliest lineages are bacterial sequences while archaeal sequences are nested inside bacterial sequences. Furthermore, the bacteria-first hypothesis is supported by available isotopic data. In conclusion, our study strongly supports the bacteria-first hypothesis.},
