## Suggested Methods Text
----------------------------------------
AlphaFold3 structures were predicted for proteins containing uTP sequences. 47 structures with strong C-terminal sequence similarity were selected and aligned using PyMOL's CE alignment algorithm. Pairwise RMSD was calculated for all structure pairs using BioPython's Superimposer after aligning on Cα atoms. A consensus structure was built by computing the mean atomic position for each aligned residue across all structures (within 3.0 Å radius), with positional variance recorded as standard deviation. Hierarchical clustering (average linkage) was performed on the RMSD distance matrix.
